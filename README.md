A webpage for displaying temperature graphs. More info [here](https://github.com/nonoo/homerseklet). You can see it working [here](http://puttony.nonoo.hu/homerseklet).

It uses dygraphs for displaying data, which is read using gettemp.csv.php. Example SQL table structure can be found in example.sql.

Data can be uploaded to the database using posttemp.php with a GET request using the posttemp.sh found in [pcsensor2](https://github.com/nonoo/pcsensor2).
